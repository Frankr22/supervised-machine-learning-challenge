# Supervised Machine Learning Challenge
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning challenge that involves creating and comparing two models to classify the risk level of personal loans for lending services companies. The two models are a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest Classifier model. The dataset used for this challenge is located in the Resources folder, and the code is written in Python using Google Colab.

## Prerequisites
To run this code, you will need to have access to Google Colab, which is a web-based platform for writing and running Python code. The following Python packages are used in this project:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Colab in your web browser.
3. Click on File > Upload notebook and select the supervised_machine_learning_challenge.ipynb file in the Supervised Machine Learning Challenge directory.
4. Run each code cell in the notebook to import the data, split the data into training and testing sets, create and fit the models, and compare their performance.
5. Modify the code as needed to fine-tune the models and improve their performance.
6. Save and download the notebook once you're finished.

Note that you may need to modify the file paths in the code to match the directory structure of your local machine or Google Drive.
